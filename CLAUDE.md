# Unified Support Dashboard — Claude Code Context

## What this is
A standalone SaaS web application that aggregates IT support tickets from Jira and ServiceDesk Plus into a single role-aware interface, with AI-powered triage, sentiment analysis, knowledge base, and custom reporting.

## Stack
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript strict, Vite 5, React Router v6, Zustand, TanStack Query v5, Shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js 20, Express 5, TypeScript strict, Zod, AWS SDK v3
- Monorepo: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo
- Infra: AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

## Key conventions
- IDs: use ULID from the "ulid" package. Never UUID
- Validation: always Zod. Import from packages/shared-types
- API errors: { error: string, code: string, statusCode: number }
- API list responses: { data: T[], cursor?: string, total: number }
- All DynamoDB queries MUST include orgId in the key condition
- All AI calls go through POST /api/ai/invoke — never call Bedrock from frontend
- Never commit .env files or secrets
